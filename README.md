## Abstract
Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow one party to prove the validity of a statement without revealing the underlying data. Folding schemes are an advanced method used in ZKPs to aggregate multiple proofs into a compact form, significantly improving scalability and efficiency. This essay explores how folding schemes work and their applications in cryptographic systems, with a focus on Ethereum-related technologies like zkRollups and recursive proofs.
